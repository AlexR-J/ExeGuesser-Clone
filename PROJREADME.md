# ExeGuesser

Our game is called ExeGuesser and it is about the navigation of Exeter campus. Much like GeoGuessr, the aim of the game is to be shown a picture and to then mark where the user thinks it is on a map.

Our source code is contained within the technical documents folder. It is the entirety of the django project and comes with a requirements file to be able to run it.

Process documents are in the equivalent file and is solely screenshots of the kanban board. The team's kaban board can also be manually accessed using this [link](https://trello.com/b/tu9JgqIX/gsp-team-31).

The product documents are found in the last folder and contains the logo of the website.
